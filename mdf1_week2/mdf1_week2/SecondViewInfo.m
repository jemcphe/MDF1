            articleText.text = @"A concussion is an injury to the most complex part of the human body that is best served by clinical experience and best treated on an individual basis. An estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million sport-related concussions are sustained every year (Langlois et al., 2006). Diagnosing sport-related concussions is one of the most elusive tasks of sports medicine clinicians (Frommer et al., 2011).\n\nMany coaches, parents, and healthcare professionals have asked the question: What’s the most effective approach to properly assess and manage concussions in athletes? Although this is hard to determine and concussion researchers are constantly assisting in this effort, we should first identify the “key players” involved in managing sport-related concussions and educate them accordingly.\n\nThere are five key players who should be involved in taking care of concussed athletes: the athletes, coaches, parents, healthcare professionals, and school professionals (in no particular order of importance). Effective communication by these key players has a significant role in managing sport-related concussions, especially at the youth and high school levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made a concerted effort to properly educate coaches about concussion and improve their ability to both recognize and manage concussions in their athletes.\n\nMost athletes are said to possess a tough mentality and rarely does any athlete want to leave a competition due to injury. Well, what if that injury could affect the way you think, the way you interact, the way you live your life? This is exactly some of the major consequences that can be caused by multiple concussions. Long-term problems associated with concussion can affect thinking, memory, learning, language, and emotions. A repeat concussion that occurs before the brain recovers from the first can slow recovery or increase the likelihood of having long-term problems (Sarmiento et al., 2010).\n\nTherefore, it is an athlete’s responsibility to notify the right personnel when experiencing some of the common symptoms of a possible concussion. A wide range of clinical signs and symptoms may be present with concussion, including physical signs, behavioral changes, cognitive impairments, somatic and emotional symptoms (Daneshvar et al., 2011).\n\nhttp://thesportdigest.com/2012/10/communication-is-key-to-managing-sport-related-concussions-2/";

            articleText.text = @"Recent information collected by the NCAA’s Injury Surveillance Program indicates that the rate of football related concussions has remained steady over an eight-year period, even as efforts have been made to recognize and record a broader range of head injuries.\n\nDuring the 2011 football season, 2.5 concussions were reported for every 1,000 game-related exposures − the periods of athletics-related activity when injuries can occur. Even though there has been a decline in concussion rate since 2004, the difference in year-to-year variability is not statistically different at this point.\n\nA concussion is a brain injury that may be caused by a blow to the head or elsewhere on the body with an “impulsive” force transmitted to the head.  They can result from hitting a hard surface, such as the ground or collision with another player, or from the head striking a helmet, elbow, or knee.\n\nConcussion rates in football had been escalating over a 21-year period beginning in the early 1980s. But the trend stabilized in recent years, becoming relatively flat from 2004-12. NCAA Director of Health and Safety David Klossner said the reasons for the previous escalating trend  are not well documented but could be due to multiple factors, including improvements in the detection and clinical management of concussion.\n\nConcussion rates in all fall sports in 2011 − including soccer, field hockey and volleyball − mirrored the football findings, with 1.9 concussions reported for every 1,000 exposures. Those numbers also fell within the range of concussions reported during the eight-year period.\n\nRecent efforts to address concussions through NCAA legislation, education and playing rules have helped NCAA institutions better recognize and treat concussions. Yet the rate of reported concussions has remained steady despite that heightened awareness.\n\n“Given the increased awareness and sensitivity to concussions by coaches, athletes and medical staff over the last few years, a level rate of concussions is encouraging as we anticipated a spike in the data set,” Klossner said. “Although we do not yet have enough information to draw final conclusions, these data are important to monitor trends as we strive to make competition and practice safer for our student-athletes in all sports.”\n\nAfter recording 532,202 football athlete exposures during games in the 2011-12 season, the largest sample of exposures analyzed during the eight-year period, the rate of concussions remained within the range recorded from the previous seven seasons. Nearly 1.85 million athlete exposures were observed in all fall sports competitions during that same period, and the overall rate was 1.9 concussions per 1,000 exposures, though it varied across sports.\n\nThe information gathered by the Injury Surveillance Program is used to provide a national systematic approach to track injury occurrences and help the NCAA and its members make informed decisions on sport rules and injury treatment to protect the health of student-athletes.\n\nhttp://thesportdigest.com/2012/10/concussion-rate-remains-steady/";

            authorLabel.text=@"by Duwayne Escobedo on September 19th, 2012";
            articleText.text = @"Christina Master is a pediatrician and sports medicine specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and fully understands the dangers concussions pose to athletes of all ages.\n\nMaster knows that some doctors insist that one concussion is one too many. Research shows that 15% of people who have a single concussion suffer long-term, persistent cognitive problems.\n\nAsked point blank why she allows her oldest son, Nathan, to play hockey when he has already suffered three diagnosed concussions and the mother and physician struggles to answer. She admits she may regret her decision in the future. So, why risk it?\n\n“Because he loves playing hockey,” she says. “We love that he loves playing hockey. We love watching him play hockey.”\n\nThroughout the documentary, “Head Games,” asks the tough questions and delivers the tough answers on concussions in sports. Director Steve James presents a fair, balanced and in-depth look at a major national public health issue that allows each viewer to make up their own minds. The acclaimed filmmaker, who also directed “Hoop Dreams” and “The Interrupters,” does this by telling compelling, real-life stories and presenting the cutting-edge science in simple, clear language.\n\n'Head Games', which opens Sept. 21, is a must-see for anyone involved in sports.\n\nVariance Films announced it plans to release the documentary, which is inspired by the book, “Head Games,” written by former Harvard football star and WWE wrestler Christopher Nowinski, on Sept. 21 in select cities and then will expand to top markets in October. Plans call for select screenings to feature guest speakers and panel discussions.\n\nIn addition, filmgoers have the opportunity to bring, “Head Games,” to their local movie theaters through Tugg, a web-based platform that empowers individuals to select a film, screening time, and nearby theater and spread the word to their online community. Once a necessary amount of people commit to attending, Tugg will reserve the theater and ensure the delivery of the movie. Also, people can choose to rent it for $6.99 off of Facebook and will have 48 hours to watch it.\n\nThe 91-minute documentary traces the concussion story back to when Nowinski first suffered a debilitating concussion as a professional wrestler, began researching and writing his book on the issue and then shared it with New York Times reporter Alan Schwarz in 2004.\n\n“I couldn’t believe I had been gladly exposing myself to concussions for 19 years and this was my first discussion that I was hearing about it,” Nowinski says when he goes to see Dr. Robert Cantu, a leading expert on concussions and their long-term effects.\n\nLike a mystery movie, the documentary chronicles the study and research done by the Center for the Study of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), taking viewers inside a morgue where Dr. Ann McKee is slicing donated brains of athletes and explaining “structural brain disease.” The lab found CTE in 14 of the first 15 brains from athletes in contact sports that it analyzed. CTE is a progressive degenerative disease, diagnosed post-mortem in individuals with a history of multiple concussions and other forms of head injury.\n\nInterwoven throughout are interviews with athletes suffering the consequences of one too many jars to the head, such as Keith Primeau, a 16-year-veteran of the NHL, and Cindy Parlow Cone, a three-time Olympic soccer player. The film also interviews award-winning sports journalist Bob Costas, NFL and NHL officials, youth athletes and their parents, and leading physicians and scientists on concussions.\n\nIn one memorable scene, former Miami Dolphins and New Orleans Saints defensive back Gene Atkins undergoes an evaluation by Cantu and fails to countdown from the number nine or recite the first six months of the year. Atkins, who suffers CTE symptoms, tells the camera: “I understand how it feels to want to take your life. It’s a scary feeling. Every day I wake up is a challenge for me. I’m just a mess right now.”\n\nThe film admits that more science is needed to immediately diagnose brain damage from head trauma, figure out risk factors and find a possible cure.\n\nAnother admission: the public education and cultural battle necessary to make a variety of contact sports safer for athletes of all ages in an effort to protect their brains may be a bigger challenge than the one to convince people that smoking may cause cancer.\n\nSays James, the film director, in a press release: “This is a film that I hope reaches a broad audience and, in particular, amateur athletes and their families, who really need to become better informed on this huge public health issue.”\n\nGiven that 1 in 8 boys have begun playing football this season, all athletes, parents and coaches should watch, “Head Games,” and ask each other: “How much are you willing to risk to play a game?”\n\nhttp://thesportdigest.com/2012/09/head-games-forces-viewers-to-confront-concussions-in-sport/";

            articleLabel.text = @"Concussion Lawsuits Consolidated into One Mega Suit";
            authorLabel.text = @"by Greg Tyler on June 11th, 2012";
            articleText.text = @"Numerous new outlets have reported recently on the many lawsuits filed against the National Football League, accusing the league of hiding information that linked football-related head trauma to permanent brain injuries. Among the illnesses cited were dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe latest news is that on June 7 attorneys filed paperwork in federal court in Philadelphia asking that some 81 lawsuits involving more than 2,200 former players as plaintiffs be consolidated into one massive action, setting up a huge and potentially costly case for the NFL.  The total number of plaintiffs, including spouses, other family members and representatives of former players, comes to more than 3,300 individuals.\n\n“The NFL must open its eyes to the consequences of its actions,” said Kevin Turner, a former running back with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles who has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). “The NFL has the power not only to give former players the care they deserve, but also to ensure that future generations of football players do not suffer the way that many in my generation have.”\n\nHelmet maker Riddell Inc. has also been named as a defendant in these actions. The suit accuses the NFL of “mythologizing” and glorifying violence through the media, including its NFL Films division.\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s, during eight years as a safety with the Atlanta Falcons, Charles “Ray” Easterling lived in a world bound only by the rules and dimensions of the football field. By last August, Easterling’s world was limited to the walls of his Richmond, Va., ranch by a brain so battered he forgot why he walked into a room by the time he got there. Easterling, despondent over the progress of his dementia and the looming need for institutional care, killed himself on April 19, 2012, at age 62.\n\n\n\nIn August 2011, Easterling, his wife and six other retired NFL players, including ex-Eagles quarterback Jim McMahon and offensive lineman Gerry Feehery and four spouses, sued the NFL seeking lifetime medical monitoring for ex-players. The suit contends that the NFL concealed the cumulative effect of multiple concussions from players.\n\n\n\nThe players hope that the lawsuit ultimately forces the NFL to be responsible for all long-term care of players suffering from chronic health problems related to traumatic brain injuries (TBI).\n\n\n\n“The NFL, like the sport of boxing, was aware of the health risks associated with repetitive blows producing sub-concussive and concussive results and the fact that some members of the NFL player population were at significant risk of developing long-term brain damage and cognitive decline as a result,” the mega suit charges.\n\n\n\n“Despite its knowledge and controlling role in governing player conduct on and off the field, the NFL turned a blind eye to the risk and failed to warn and/or impose safety regulations governing this well-recognized health and safety problem.”\n\n\n\nPredictably, NFL officials continue to deny any liability in this area, citing the many health programs it runs for current and former players, and a series of medical benefits to former NFL players to help them after football.  ”The NFL has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so,” the league said in a statement. “Any allegation that the NFL sought to mislead players has no merit. It stands in contrast to the league’s many actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions.”\n\n\n\nThe league added that in partnership with the NFL Players Association it has spent more than $1 billion on pensions, medical and disability benefits for retired players.\n\n\n\nMomentum has been building for some time to hold the NFL accountable in this area.  Former All-Pro defensive back Dave Duerson committed suicide on February 17, 2011.  His brain was donated by his family for research and found to have been suffering from TBI.  Just recently on May 2, former All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau was found dead in his San Diego area home, the victim of a suicide.\n\n\n\nAll three of these individuals were reported as having engaged in erratic behavior often associated with people suffering from the long-term effects of concussions.  Recent research has also suggested a positive link between the incidence of ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) among former football players, such as Turner, and TBI.\n\n\n\n Attorneys for plaintiffs say they are not trying to bankrupt the NFL. They simply want recognition of the problem and for the NFL to step forward to help the suffering players and their families cope with the huge financial costs associated with their conditions. They also want the sport made safer for present and future players.\n\n\n\nThe fact remains, however, that these lawsuits have the potential to wreak financial havoc on the league and its owners.  The league has asked that all of these lawsuits be dismissed because they are preempted under federal labor law by the collective bargaining agreement with the players.  It is in fact true that a recent lawsuit filed by retired players alleges that they were unfairly left out of the recent talks that led to last year’s labor agreement.  The judge in that case ruled that they had no standing to contest anything dealing with collective bargaining and that their “agent” is the players union.\n\n\n\nThat, of course, angers retired players who have been trying for several years to get help from the union in pursuing better treatment from the league on disability issues.\n\n\n\nThousands of families scattered across the country are quietly leading desperate lives as they seek to cope with post-football injuries affecting ex-players.  The current litigation may turn out to be more important than any NFL game any of these players ever played in.  The future of football as we know it could also be at stake.\n\nhttp://thesportdigest.com/2012/06/concussion-lawsuits-consolidated-into-one-mega-suit/";

            authorLabel.text = @"by Digest Editor on May 25th, 2012";
            articleText.text = @"Youth football leagues across the country will soon begin to sign players up for their fall leagues. But there is a growing concern, even among star football players, that football is simply too dangerous for our youth.\n\nFormer Rams and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner recently said that the prospect of his young sons playing football is a “scary thing.” More recently the father of three-time league MVP quarterback Tom Brady has said that if he knew then what he knows now he might have prevented his son from ever playing football.\n\nCurrently, the line of former players suing the NFL over traumatic brain injuries stands at more than 2,200 players who have joined some 80 separate lawsuits. These suits all basically allege that NFL officials and owners knew for years about the dangers posed by repeated blows to the head sustained by NFL players and failed to protect them.\n\nThe Center for Injury Biomechanics, a joint project of Virginia Tech and Wake Forest universities, estimates that there are 2,000 professional, 100,000 college, 1.3 million high school and 3.5 million youth football players in the U.S.  Early studies they have conducted suggest that traumatic hits do occur in football all the way down to 7 and 8 year olds.  A majority of the hits occurring in youth leagues come during practice and not games.  Researchers suggest that youth leagues adopt the policy the NFL mandated in 2011 and ban hard hits in practice.\n\nIt has to be noted that studies of youth players are in the early stages.  Attitudes about the sport formed over the past 100-plus years aren’t going to be changed overnight.  Proponents of change frequently point out that they don’t want to eliminate contact football and have everyone play flag football.  They simply want to improve protective gear and to take blows with the helmet completely out of the game.\n\nThat is easier said than done.  Since 2009 the NFL has been fining players for excessive blows delivered with a helmet.  Many players have been outspoken in opposition to what many see as a “sissification” of the game.\n\nMany people are watching to see if participation by teenagers and younger players remains steady.  People are also watching to see if concerns about providing better equipment, safety training and availability of medical treatment at game sites drives up the costs of the sport to a point where many schools, leagues and families simply cannot afford to let their boys play.\n\nSince 2009, 35 states have passed laws that prohibit players on school teams from returning to play after taking a blow that was diagnosed as a concussion until they have medical clearance from a doctor.  Keith Guskiewicz, a researcher at the University of North Carolina and a member of the NFL’s Head, Neck and Spine Committee, is currently testing whether the use of sensors in helmets and mouth guards can reliably detect and measure head impacts and lead to development of better helmets and contact rules.\n\nGuskiewicz headed a three-year survey of college and high school players that reported in 2000 that 5.6% of high school players and 4.4% of college players sustained at least one concussion per season.  This finding supports the idea that younger players may be at higher risk of sustaining major brain injuries.  He attributes this to less coaching expertise, particularly in proper teaching of protective techniques on the field.\n\n Very few people actually want to see the sport of American football permanently sidelined.  There is too much money at stake in any event to foresee a time when tackle football is no longer played.  Cynics point out that then President Theodore Roosevelt led the outcry against violence in college football in the first decade of the 20th century—pressure that helped lead to the creation of the NCAA to implement rules leading to safer play.  Yet over 100 years later, we are still addressing the same issues.\n\nIt was great as a kid to watch Detroit Lion safety Dick “Night Train” Lane bring down opponents with his infamous clothesline tackle.  Fans of that era were also thrilled about the violent world of New York Giants middle linebacker Sam Huff and watched Chicago Bears games to see who the next victim of middle linebacker Dick Butkus would be.  The threat of violence was part of the rapid growth of interest in pro football.\n\nThe reality is that our society is at a crossroads with respect to football.  If significant progress is not made in providing better, safer playing conditions for players, then the game millions love just might vanish into the mists of history.\n\nhttp://thesportdigest.com/2012/05/football-too-violent-for-its-own-good/";

            authorLabel.text = @"by Evan Weiner on May 8th, 2012";
            articleText.text = @"I didn’t know Junior Seau although I met him on the day he was drafted into the National Football League in 1990 and probably interviewed him after a football game a few times more. From all accounts, he was a fearsome presence on the football field; a killer who at times could control a game defensively.\n\nBut Junior Seau didn’t live to be a ripe old age and until an autopsy is performed and a police investigation is complete, there is no need to speculate about the circumstances surrounding Seau’s death other than he was found dead of a shotgun wound on the morning of May 2, 2012\n\nThe gun wound should strike a nerve among former players. It seems that is becoming a way of life and death among NFL alum suffering from life altering injuries that probably came from years and years of absorbing hits on the football field.  Seau is now just another former player who is dead from unnatural circumstances.\n\nThere is either some serendipity or karma about Seau’s death because National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell had just announced the suspension of four players who performed with the 2010 New Orleans Saints football team who allegedly put up money to knock out opposing players.\n\nFootball was nearly banned in the very early part of the 20th century by President Theodore Roosevelt when players were maimed or died on the field during college games. Roosevelt forced football people and college presidents to “clean up the game.”\n\nThe National Football League’s modern day success was partially built on the “Violent World of Sam Huff” a 1960 CBS news magazine show which featured Huff and the Giants and the way the team played defensive football.\n\nThe sport is entertainment for fans but there have been tragic consequences for some of Sunday’s grid iron heroes. In April, former Atlanta Falcons player Ray Easterling killed himself. The suicide death of one-time Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson in 2011 received plenty of coverage but that didn’t stop former players from ultimately taking their own lives.\n\nThis reporter gets many e-mails and calls from former players. A column on Gene Atkins, a former defensive back with the New Orleans Saints led a former player to call me.\n\n“I read the story you did on Gene Atkins,” said the former player who was on a Super Bowl championship team. “In reading this story, I felt that I was reading about myself. I am currently on SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) and Non-Degenerative NFL Disability. I have been diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome. I have been in a rehab facility twice to treat my depression, cognitive learning and chronic pain. I have been struggling with my depression, loss of memory and chronic pain for a long time. It was hard – and is still hard – for me to accept. I get really confused when the NFL doesn’t accept me. The NFL don’t even have a number for retired players that are depressed or even suicidal. Dave Duerson was my friend. We talked and played in golf tournaments after we retired. What he did could have easily been me.\n\nLook at the number of NFL safeties that are going through the same problems. We all played around the same time and all were known as and trained to be head hunters. Seek and destroy– that’s what (a coach) told me to do. Make people afraid to come in your territory. I had my best game in the Super Bowl and don’t even remember playing in that game. I only know what happened by watching the tapes and talking to the players. I was knocked out during the first series of the game and had my nose broken when (a running back’s) forearm came throw my open face mask.\n\n“Just wanted to let you know that these bounties didn’t just start.  I won’t say under what coach and who directed it; but I received bounty monies and so did a lot of my teammates. We all were excited about going to the early Monday morning meeting. This is when we got our cash for big hits, knockout, roaches and whatever name you wanted to use. We got paid in cash and watched film as a team to make decisions on what hits would qualify.\n\n“The goal was to knock players out and the easiest way was on special teams. And everyone that was any type of a hitter wanted to be on special teams. This wasn’t for everybody – only the big hitters.”\n\nThe former player in question has not followed up after his e-mails. But his story is quite similar to many others. Depression, loss of family, living on the government dole because the National Football League Players Association never negotiated a post-career benefit package is common.\n\nPlayers Association Executive Directors from Ed Garvey to Gene Upshaw to DeMaurice Smith have traded future benefits for “Money Now”, which was the slogan of the players during the 1982 National Football League Players Association walkout. The players association failed the membership in 1982, 1987 and every subsequent collective bargaining negotiation.\n\nGoodell, the New Orleans Saints franchise, Saints management, coaches and players are lucky that law enforcement officials are not at initial glance investigating the whole bounty case and that the league is being allowed to handle the situation.\n\nThat’s exactly what sports leagues and organizations want–the ability to impose sport discipline not legal discipline on employees.\n\nThe NBA now has a National Football League owner in his league. Tom Benson just purchased the New Orleans Hornets franchise which will now be his second active professional sports franchise in the city. Benson had owned an Arena Football League team in New Orleans.\n\nDuring the news conference introducing Benson as the new Hornets owner, Stern told the “probing” media that Benson would not answer any questions about his Saints, the bounties, the suspensions imposed on Saints upper management and coaches and that he was there to talk about basketball.\n\n“With all due respect Commissioner Stern, Mr. Benson was handed over $186.5 million between 2002-10 as a thank you for keeping the Saints in New Orleans despite having a long-term lease. The state has rebuilt the SuperDome at a cost of many millions of dollars, the state has created a tax-free zone between the Dome and the arena and Mr. Benson bought the Dominion Tower from the state, renovating it and then renting office space to the state. Given that Mr. Benson is getting hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayers, it is incumbent upon him to answer questions. Are you, Mr. Stern, afraid of real questions?”\n\nSports leagues do control United States media. Leagues and colleges are partners with CBS, Disney (ESPN), Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, Comcast’s NBC Universal and Time Warner. Local newspapers own some teams or have a business relationship with privately owned teams. The “big” names of sports reporting have done relatively little to justify their reputations.\n\nBob Costas talked about steroid usage in baseball in the 1990s as did the Washington Post’s Tom Boswell. That is about the extent of reporting in sports. The Lupicas, the Alboms and the rest of the big city sports columnists fall flat on their collective faces when reporting on sports real issues. There is an awful lot of hype surrounding Bryant Gumbel’s HBO show but there is little substance in the program.\n\nWill the media wake up and really cover sports like a business? Doubtful unless you count Mike Lupica’s Madison Square Garden experience as better when the Knicks win so they better sign the right stars to make the Garden rock like it did in 1994.\n\nJunior Seau will be lauded in death and remembered as a great player. But to some, he is just another statistic. Another young man, 43, who died prematurely after a spectacular career. There are newer and younger stars who will provide Sunday or Monday night or Thursday night entertainment; and Friday night high school football is still revered as is Saturday college football. The players are interchangeable and disposable. The games will go on.\n\nhttp://thesportdigest.com/2012/05/evan-weiner-junior-seaus-death-another-football-statistic/";
